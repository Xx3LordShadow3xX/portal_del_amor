---

## 📋 STEP-BY-STEP UPLOAD INSTRUCTIONS

### Step 1: Delete Old File
```bash
# DELETE THIS FILE:
js/weather.js  ← This is the old monolithic file

## 🔍 HOW THE MODULAR SYSTEM WORKS

### Module Communication Flow:

```
main.js
  └─> Initializes WeatherCore
       └─> WeatherCore manages weather switching
            ├─> ClearSkyWeather.start()
            ├─> HeartRainWeather.start()
            └─> LoveSnowWeather.start()
                 ├─> Starts snowfall animation
                 ├─> Creates mountains/clouds
                 └─> Initializes subsystems:
                      ├─> SnowDayNight.start()
                      ├─> SnowAurora.init()
                      ├─> SnowBlizzard.start()
                      ├─> SnowSantaSleigh.start()
                      ├─> SnowPineTrees.create()
                      └─> SnowCabin.create()
```

### Benefits:
✅ Each file is small and manageable (<250 lines)
✅ Easy to find and fix bugs
✅ Can work on one feature without breaking others
✅ Clear separation of concerns
✅ Easy to add new weather types
✅ Easy to add new snow subsystems

## 🎨 FILE RESPONSIBILITIES

### **weather-core.js**
- Manages weather switching
- Handles UI (weather button, menu)
- Coordinates between weather modules
- Cleanup/stop all weather systems

### **clear-sky.js**

- Heart particles with 3 depth layers
- Wind system with gusts
- Rain background streaks
- Cloud layer
- Splash effects

### **love-snow.js**
- Snowfall particles with 3 depth layers
- Wind system (gentler than rain)
- Snow background particles

## 🚨 IMPORTANT NOTES

### Script Load Order Matters!
The order in `index.html` is critical:
1. Music player (independent)
2. Weather core (base system)
3. Weather modules (depend on core)
4. Snow subsystems (depend on love-snow)
5. Love snow main (coordinates subsystems)
6. Main app (initializes everything)

### Dependencies:
- **Weather modules** check `WeatherCore.currentWeather`
- **Snow subsystems** check `WeatherCore.currentWeather === 'love-snow'`
- **Blizzard** notifies Santa and trees via their modules
- **Day/night** notifies aurora
- All modules can work independently

### Adding New Weather:
1. Create new file in `js/weather/your-weather.js`
2. Follow the same pattern as `clear-sky.js`
3. Add to `index.html` script tags
4. Add case in `weather-core.js` switch statement

### Adding New Snow Feature:
1. Create new file in `js/weather/snow-systems/your-feature.js`
2. Follow pattern of existing subsystems
3. Add to `index.html` before `love-snow.js`
4. Initialize in `love-snow.js` start() method

## 🐛 IF SOMETHING BREAKS

1. **Open Browser Console (F12)**
2. **Look for error messages**
3. **Check which file is mentioned**
4. **Common issues:**
   - `X is not defined` → Script loaded in wrong order
   - `Cannot read property` → Module not initialized
   - `X.start is not a function` → Module file not loaded
