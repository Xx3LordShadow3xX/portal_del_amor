9. **Mountain Scene** - Layered depth with fog

### Animation Quality Standards
All animations follow professional-grade principles:
- **No straight lines** - All movement follows curves
- **Layered depth** - 3+ layers for 3D parallax effect
- **Natural physics** - Gravity, wind, momentum simulated
- **Smooth transitions** - Ease-in/out for all state changes
- **Performance optimized** - RequestAnimationFrame, particle limits
- **Responsive timing** - Random delays prevent repetitive patterns

### Key Features

## 💡 Usage Tips

### Love Snow Theme Best Practices
1. **First Visit**: Wait 10-15 seconds to see all systems initialize
2. **Day/Night Cycle**: Full cycle takes 5 minutes - be patient!
3. **Northern Lights**: Only visible during night phase (lasts 75 seconds)
4. **Blizzards**: Random timing - watch for screen shake
5. **Santa Sleigh**: Appears every 1-2 minutes, takes 35 seconds to cross
6. **Christmas Tree**: Look for twinkling lights among pine trees

### Performance Notes
- **Recommended**: Desktop browser with hardware acceleration
- **If lagging**: Close other tabs, disable browser extensions
- **Mobile**: Some effects may be reduced for performance

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Music won't play:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify MP3 file paths are correct
- Ensure browser allows audio autoplay (user interaction required)

**Weather effects not showing:**
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Ensure all JS files are loaded in correct order
- Verify CSS files are properly linked

**Santa sleigh missing:**
- Check Console for PNG loading errors
- Verify `assets/reindeer.png` and `assets/santa-sleigh.png` exist
- Check file paths are correct (case-sensitive)

**Cabin not showing:**
- Verify `assets/cabin.png` exists and is loaded
- Check Console for 404 errors
- Ensure image has transparency (PNG format)

**Performance issues:**
- Reduce particle count in weather.js (`maxParticles` variable)
- Close other browser tabs
- Disable weather effects temporarily
- Try a different browser

**Northern Lights not appearing:**
- Wait for night phase (check Console for time change logs)
- Full day/night cycle takes 5 minutes
- Aurora fades in over 5 seconds
